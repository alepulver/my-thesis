# Results analysis

The subjects' data can be accessed through the appropriate URL, but as it's not always fetched properly I recommend using `links`. Otherwise the database dump can be obtained with [db-tools](https://github.com/meteor-london/db-tools) in BJSON (Binary JSON) and converted to regular (plain text) JSON.

A script for generating reports is available as `runner.py`. The tests can be run with `nosetests`.
