# Results analysis

The subjects' data can be accessed through the appropriate URL, but as it's not always fetched properly I recommend using `links`. Otherwise the database dump can be obtained with [db-tools](https://github.com/meteor-london/db-tools) in BJSON (Binary JSON) and converted to regular (plain text) JSON.

A script for analysis of the quantity and "completeness" of experiments is available as `generate_stats.py`. To get the data as a CSV, use `generate_results.py`.

## TODO
