# Results Visualizations

I'm using [PyX](http://pyx.sourceforge.net/), but noticed the following possible alternatives:

- [grid](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html): low-level interface used by [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), for R
- [compose](https://github.com/dcjones/Compose.jl): low-level interface used by [gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org/), for Julia
- [Artist](http://matplotlib.org/1.4.0/users/artists.html): objects used by [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/): promising monadic interface for Haskell
- [cairo](http://cairographics.org/): complex, and doesn't have active high-level interfaces
- LaTeX packages for drawing (like [TikZ](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/TikZ_package) and
  [PSTricks](http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi)) with extensions, but I prefer a general programming language
