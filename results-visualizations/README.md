# Results Visualizations

I'm using [PyX](http://pyx.sourceforge.net/), because [cairo](http://cairographics.org/) is more complex and I didn't find other active projects providing a high level interface to draw vector graphics.
The most reasonable alternatives seem to be low-level graphic libraries used by plotting packages; for example, [grid](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html) (used by [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), for R) and [compose](https://github.com/dcjones/Compose.jl) (used by [gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org/), for Julia).
[Diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) (for Haskell) also looks promising.
