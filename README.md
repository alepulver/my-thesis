# My thesis

## Introduction

Neuroscience experiments for my thesis project.

There is a Python and a Javascript (web, both client and server) version.

## Javascript version

It should work on modern web browsers as well as mobile devices, but the primary target is the web.

The idea is to use [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/) for graphics and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for the server.

### Install

```
# Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh

# Install Node.js
nvm install v0.11.9

# Install meteor
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

# Install meteorite (package manager)
npm install -g meteorite
```

### Run locally

```
cd myapp
meteor
```

And enter the following url: http://localhost:3000/

Source modifications are reloaded automatically.
