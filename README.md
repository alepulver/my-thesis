# My thesis

This repository contains the neuroscience experiment for my thesis project, and related utilities.

The following components are available (each one with its own documentation):

- Original [tablet prototype](python-circles/README.md), written in Python (incomplete)
- Current [Meteor Web App](meteor-webapp/README.md), written in Javascript (finished)
- [Some tests](python-workflow/README.md) for avoiding callbacks, which weren't used in the end
- Results [table generator](results-tables/README.md), that reads the collected raw JSON data
- Results [screenshot generator](results-screenshots/README.md), to generate final images for each stage
- Results [visualization generator](results-visualizations/README.md), for creating more elaborate plots
