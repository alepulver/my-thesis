# My thesis

Neuroscience experiments for my thesis project.

There is an old [Python version](python-circles/README.md), and the [current one](myapp/README.md) written in Javascript.

A few prototypes for avoiding callbacks, which weren't used in the end, are [here](python-workflow/README.md).

Scripts and results of data analysis are in [myapp-results](myapp-results/README.md).
